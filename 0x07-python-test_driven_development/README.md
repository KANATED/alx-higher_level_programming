Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The TDD process typically follows these steps:

1. **Write a Test:**
   - Begin by defining a small, specific unit of functionality that you want to implement (e.g., a function or method).
   - Write a test that checks for the expected behavior of this functionality. The test should fail initially since the code to implement the functionality hasn't been written yet.

2. **Run the Test:**
   - Execute the test to ensure it fails as expected. This confirms that the test is correctly detecting the absence of the functionality you're about to implement.

3. **Write the Minimum Code:**
   - Implement the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. Focus on just enough to satisfy the test, without adding unnecessary complexity.

4. **Run All Tests:**
   - After writing the code, run all the tests in your suite. This helps ensure that the new code didn't break any existing functionality. If any test fails, fix the code to address the issues.

5. **Refactor (if needed):**
   - If the code is functional and all tests pass, consider refactoring to improve code quality without changing its behavior. Refactoring should also be done with confidence, knowing that the existing tests will catch any regressions.

6. **Repeat:**
   - Repeat the process for the next small unit of functionality. Write a new test, watch it fail, implement the code, and ensure all tests pass.

The main advantages of TDD include:

- **Early Detection of Bugs:** TDD helps catch bugs early in the development process, making them easier and less expensive to fix.

- **Better Design:** Writing tests first encourages modular and loosely coupled code, leading to more maintainable and scalable systems.

- **Documentation:** Tests serve as living documentation, providing insight into how the code should behave.

- **Confidence in Changes:** With a comprehensive suite of tests, developers can confidently make changes or additions to the codebase, knowing that existing functionality won't break unnoticed.

TDD is a disciplined and iterative approach to software development that can contribute to the production of robust and high-quality code.
